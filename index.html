        <h1>Michał Barciś, PhD</h1>
        <h3>Bio:</h3>
        <p>
            Michał Barciś is a Lead Researcher at the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, UAE. 
            His main interest lies in making robots work in the real world, which allows the research to come true.

            During his career, Michał took part in various robotic competitions. Among them, two are perhaps worth mentioning the most: first place in DroneBot competition in Deep Drone Challenge 2021 (prototypes of autonomous drone capable of communication with air traffic control) and second place in University Rover Challenge 2017 (Mars rover competition).

            He completed his PhD on the topic of "Information Distribution in Multi-Robot Systems" in the doctoral school named Karl Popper Kolleg on Networked Autonomous Aerial Vehicles at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria. 
            He has obtained his Master's and Bachelor's degrees in computer science at the University of Wrocław in Poland.
